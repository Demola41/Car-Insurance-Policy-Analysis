- <a href="https://github.com/Demola41/Car-Insurance-Policy-Analysis/blob/main/Car%20Insurance%20Policies%20Dashboard.png">[Dashboard Preview]</a>
## 1. Situation
Analyzed insurance data for **37,542 customers** to assess risk factors driving **$1.88B** in total claims.
## 2. Task
The objective was to determine correlations between customer demographics (income, education), vehicle characteristics, and claim frequency to support data-driven risk assessment.
## 3. Action
Utilized **Microsoft Excel** to design a dynamic dashboard.
* **Interactive Filtering:** Implemented Slicers to allow segmentation by education and coverage zone.
* **Risk Visualization:** Created combo charts to visualize the relationship between claim frequency and total claim amounts ($98K average).
## 4. Results & Insights
* **Demographic Risk:** "High Income" households were identified as the most frequent claimants contrary to initial assumptions.
* **Education Factor:** Bachelors degree holders accounted for **50%** of the total claim volume.
## 5. Recommendation
* **Premium Adjustment:** Adjust premium models specifically for "Urban" and "High Income" demographics.
* **Risk Mitigation:** The data proved these segments generate the highest average claim costs (**$50.4K**), presenting the highest financial risk to the insurer.
